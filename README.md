# This is my First Devops Project. I'm planning to crete sample CI/CD Pipeline with git,github,jenkins.

I've create sample project folder locally
Initialted git init
created program files in local machine

Aim1 : implement and practice Git commands to achieve Versioning files in a project.

Steps

# Adding file to track
git add  
# Commiting changes
git commit -m "commit name"
# Create a branch
git branch "branch name"
# checkout to branch i.e switching to other branches
git checkout branch name
# Create a brach and check out to it
git branch -M "branch name"  
# How to check which branch i'm currently IN
git branch
# How to add repository to Github
